#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a _frontend developer who also makes a lot of UI decisions_.<br>
I prefer working in a small team where people have cross-domain knowledge. This kind of setup allows teams to easily close the communication gap and produce quality work at high efficiency.

#### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about _blockchain_.<br>
In my spare time, I enjoy reading whitepapers and getting frustrated by the complexity.
