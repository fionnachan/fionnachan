#### ðŸ”¨ Skills
As a frontend dev by trade, I'm comfortable with
- HTML: started with HTML4 `<font size="5" color="blue">*~ HELLO ~*</font>`
- CSS: happy to build a big CSS library from scratch
- JavaScript: my first programming lang at 8 - it is special to me!
- TypeScript: easier to read & maintain the code
- React with Hooks: I didn't like React before Hooks!
- git: using it from the command line, not the GUI
- building reusable frontend component libraries from scratch
- design UX of webapps
- all sorts of fancy tools in frontend: npm/yarn/pnpm, webpack/vite, you name it and I'll pick it up

#### ðŸ¤” I'm looking to learn these programming things in-depth
- Rust: high performance, why not?
- WebAssembly: because the modern browser is so cool
- Python: there are a lot of opensource codebase in Python and I want to understand & contribute

#### ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning everything about Blockchain
...from writing smart contracts, to the VMs.

Blockchain brings back good ol' memories of the 2000s. I was too young to build anything substantial back then but this time I'm determined to give it my all. ðŸ˜Ž

#### ðŸ˜„ Within the blockchain space, I am interested in
- learning about similaries and differences in technical capabilities among various L1s and L2s
- developer onboarding strategies adopted by different chains
- developer experience in building dApps on different chains
- end-user acquisition strategies adopted by different chains and protocols
- innovations in DeFi, NFT, DAO, DID, etc

Talk to me about blockchain tech and we'll be best friends. ðŸ¤—
